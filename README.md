# Blogged - Django Blog Application

This is a simple blog application I built with Django. It features post listing, detailed post views with slug-based URLs, and a commenting system powered by Django forms.

## Features

- List all blog posts with latest posts first
- View individual post detail pages with comments
- Add new comments to posts with a user-friendly form
- URL slugs for SEO-friendly URLs
- Admin interface to manage posts and comments

- Backend: Django 5.2.4 with built-in ORM, forms, and templating
- Database: SQLite (default Django setup)
- Frontend: Django Templates, HTML, and CSS
